                Long Noncoding RNA: Recent Updates in Atherosclerosis.</a><br/>
            <small><b>Abstract</b>
                Long noncoding RNAs belong to a class of noncoding RNAs longer than 200 nucleotides with the
                epigenetic regulation potential. As a novel molecular regulator, lncRNAs are often dysregulated
                in various pathological conditions and display multiple functions in a wide range of biological
                processes. Given that recent studies have indicated that lncRNAs are involved in
                atherosclerosis-related smooth muscle cell, endothelial cell, macrophage and lipid metabolism
                regulation, it is pertinent to understand the potential function of lncRNAs in atherosclerosis
                development. This review will highlight the recent updates of lncRNAs in atherogenesis and also
                discuss their potential roles as novel therapeutic targets.
